# CISO Work Cycle

A sophisticated project management and visualization platform designed specifically for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to track, analyze, and communicate the progress of cybersecurity initiatives across their organization.

## 🎯 Overview

The CISO Work Cycle transforms complex project portfolios into intuitive visual narratives, enabling security leaders to effectively communicate project status, resource allocation, and strategic priorities to stakeholders at all levels. Built on the proven custom maturity curve methodology, this platform provides a unique perspective on cybersecurity project maturity and organizational readiness.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

  - **Unplanned Work**: Emergency responses and reactive initiatives
  - **IS Projects**: Core information security implementations
  - **IT/Business Projects**: Cross-functional technology initiatives
  - **Business-as-Usual**: Ongoing operational activities
- **Timeline Visualization**: Clear symbols indicate project timelines (next month, quarter, half, year, or on hold)
- **Resource Planning**: Risk and complexity ratings help prioritize resource allocation

### 💼 **Executive Communication**
- **Stakeholder-Ready Dashboards**: Clean, professional interface suitable for board presentations
- **Progress Narratives**: Visual storytelling that translates technical complexity into business impact
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### 🔍 **Interactive Analysis**
- **Detailed Project Insights**: Hover interactions reveal comprehensive project details
- **Contextual Information**: Instant access to risk assessments, complexity ratings, and timeline data
- **Adaptive Layout**: Interface optimizes for different screen sizes and use cases

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Modern Web Stack**
- **Next.js 13.5**: React-based framework with App Router for optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety ensuring robust, maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for consistent, responsive design

## 📊 Data Model

### Project Structure
```typescript
interface Project {
  name: string;           // Project identifier
  position: number;       // Position on curve (0-1)
  category: string;       // Project category
  risk: 'L' | 'M' | 'H';  // Risk assessment
  complexity: 'L' | 'M' | 'H'; // Complexity rating
  timeline: Timeline;     // Expected completion
}
```

### Timeline Indicators
- `○` Next Month - Immediate priorities
- `●` Next Quarter - Short-term goals  
- `△` Next Half - Medium-term planning
- `▲` Next Year - Long-term initiatives
- `⊗` On Hold - Paused projects

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Projects
Edit `lib/data.ts` to add new projects:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Your Project Name',
  position: 0.5,  // 0 = start of curve, 1 = end
  category: 'IS Projects',
  risk: 'M',
  complexity: 'H',
  timeline: 'next quarter'
}
```

### Styling Customization
- Modify `app/globals.css` for global theme changes
- Update Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Customize component styles in individual component files
