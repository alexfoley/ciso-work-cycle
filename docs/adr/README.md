# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following Michael Nygard's format, documenting significant architectural decisions for the CISO Work Cycle platform.

## Writing Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Impact system architecture or security posture
- Affect multiple components or future development
- Involve significant trade-offs between approaches
- Have security, performance, or compliance implications
- Establish patterns that future decisions will follow

### ADR Process

1. **Copy the template**: Use [template.md](./template.md) as your starting point
2. **Number sequentially**: Use the next available ADR number
3. **Name descriptively**: Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `ADR-006-your-decision-title.md`)
4. **Update this index**: Add your ADR to the table above
5. **Get review**: Architecture decisions benefit from team input
6. **Commit to main**: Once accepted, the decision is official

### Status Values

- **Proposed**: Under consideration, seeking feedback
- **Accepted**: Approved and implemented or being implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but kept for history
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (reference which one)

### Required Sections

Every ADR must include:
- **Context**: What problem or need motivated this decision?
- **Decision**: What did we decide to do?
- **Consequences**: What are the results of this decision?
- **Security Impact**: How does this affect our security posture?
