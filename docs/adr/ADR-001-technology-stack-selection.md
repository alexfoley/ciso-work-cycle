# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2025-09-30

**Decision Makers:** CISO, Development Team, Security Architecture

## Context

The CISO Work Cycle requires a technology stack that balances executive presentation quality, development velocity, security posture, and long-term maintainability. The platform must serve dual purposes:

1. **Executive Interface**: Board-ready visualizations requiring professional polish and reliability
2. **Technical Tool**: Developer-friendly platform supporting rapid iteration and feature development

Key constraints:
- **Timeline**: 9-day delivery for executive presentation
- **Security**: Zero-vulnerability baseline required for CISO credibility
- **Performance**: Must render smoothly on 4K displays for board presentations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive executive access

## Decision

**Primary Stack:**
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.33 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict type checking
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.3 with design system
- **Components**: Custom React components (ProgressCurve, Header, Sidebar)
- **Build System**: Next.js static generation (SSG)
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Vercel/Netlify)

**Alternative Stacks Considered:**

| Framework | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|-----------|------|------|----------|
| **Angular** | Enterprise features, strong typing | Heavy bundle, steep learning curve | ❌ Rejected |
| **Vue.js** | Gentle learning curve, good docs | Smaller ecosystem for enterprise | ❌ Rejected |
| **React SPA** | Maximum flexibility | Requires manual optimization | ❌ Rejected |
| **Next.js** ✅ | SSG, security, performance, ecosystem | Learning curve for SSR concepts | ✅ **Selected** |

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Security**: Built-in security headers, CSP support, and automatic vulnerability scanning
- **Performance**: Static generation eliminates runtime dependencies and improves loading speed
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling, hot reloading, and TypeScript integration
- **Ecosystem**: Access to React ecosystem and enterprise-grade component libraries
- **SEO/Accessibility**: Server-side rendering improves crawlability and screen reader support
- **Deployment**: Simple static hosting reduces infrastructure complexity and costs

### Negative

- **Build Complexity**: Static generation adds build-time complexity compared to client-only React
- **Learning Curve**: Team must understand SSG/SSR concepts and Next.js conventions
- **Framework Lock-in**: Tied to Next.js ecosystem and Vercel deployment patterns

### Neutral

- **Bundle Size**: Comparable to other modern React frameworks (~87KB shared chunks)
- **Browser Support**: Excellent modern browser support, limited IE support (acceptable for target audience)

## Security Impact

- **Threat Model Changes**:
  - ✅ Eliminates server-side attack vectors (no backend API)
  - ✅ Reduces dependency on runtime services
  - ⚠️ Requires client-side security considerations (XSS prevention)

- **Attack Surface**:
  - Minimized to static assets and client-side JavaScript
  - Content Security Policy controls resource loading
  - Subresource Integrity validates asset authenticity

- **Compliance**:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA achievable through semantic HTML and ARIA support
  - Security baseline established with zero vulnerabilities

## Implementation Notes

- **Timeline**: Framework selection completed Day 1, full implementation by Day 3
- **Migration Strategy**: N/A (greenfield project)
- **Rollback Plan**: Custom components are framework-agnostic and portable to other React frameworks
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Build time < 10 seconds
  - Bundle size < 100KB first load
  - Lighthouse score > 95
